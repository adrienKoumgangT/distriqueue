\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

TaskForce successfully demonstrates a complete distributed job scheduling system that addresses the core challenge of distributed systems:
coordination, communication, and fault tolerance.
The project fulfills all course requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Synchronization/Coordination}: Raft consensus, CRDTs, distributed locks
    \item \textbf{Communication}: RabbitMQ, HTTP/REST, SSE, Erlang messaging
    \item \textbf{Erlang Component}: Full orchestrator with OTP behaviors
    \item \textbf{Multi-node Deployment}: VM deployments
\end{enumerate}

The system achieves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High availability} through clustering and automatic failover
    \item \textbf{Scalability} by adding worker nodes
    \item \textbf{Reliability} with exactly-once execution semantics
    \item \textbf{Observability} via comprehensive monitoring
    \item \textbf{Extensibility} through polyglot worker architecture
\end{itemize}

This project represents not just a course requirement, but a production-quality distributed system that demonstrates deep understanding of
distributed systems principles and their practical implementation.
The code is well-structured, documented, and ready for extension.

The experience gained from implementing Raft from scratch, integrating multiple technologies, and deploying on real VMs has provided invaluable insight
into the challenges and solutions in distributed systems engineering.
